# chatgpt_API_web
Use ChatGPT API on the web

Build my own web version of ChatGPT using its API, together with the latest (as of 03 March 2023) **gpt-3.5-turbo** model, on a Mac.

## Requirement
- Installation of **[openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)** and **[gradio](https://pypi.org/project/gradio/)**
- Mac (to use the AppleScript to build an *app-like* which actually opens the chat interface in a browser tab, here I used Safari)
- ChatGPT API key
